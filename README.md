# Securly Unblocker 1
This is not to be mistaken with SU4 or SU5, as the founders of both have joined together to make this unblocker (even though SU5 literally copied me, the creator of SU4 when they accidentally stumbled about the source lol), which combines their scripts (credits to the creators of the scripts) and a complete rewrite of the GUIs, functionalities, and future expansion windows, we present to you, the SU1 Tool.

## What can I do with this tool?

Well, to start off, unblock securly (I mean, its literally in the name). Aside from that, games, random misc tools, proxies, and unblockers are already present, and even thoguh this is the first beta release (4/4/2022), we have many features, and a practical game hub for anyone who wants to use it. Currently access is free, however in the future, as we grow expanentially, we may start using a small amount of ads. 

## How do I get it?

bookmarklet:

javascript:(function()%7Bconst loadScript %3D async(url) %3D> %7B%0A    const response %3D await fetch(url)%0A    const script %3D await response.text()%0A    eval(script)%0A%7D%0A%0Aconst scriptUrl %3D "https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsecurlyunblocker%2FSU1%2Fmain%2Fmain.js"%0AloadScript(scriptUrl)%7D)()%3B
